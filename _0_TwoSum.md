# Two Sum Problem in Java

## Problem Description
The **Two Sum** problem requires finding two indices in an array such that the numbers at those indices sum to a given target. The solution should return the indices of the two numbers.

### Example:
- **Input**: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
- **Output**: `[0, 1]` because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`

## Code Explanation

### Brute Force Approach

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    // Loop through each element in the array, except the last one
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        // For each element, check the elements that come after it
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            // Check if the sum of the current pair equals the target
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                // If a match is found, return the indices of the two elements
                return new int[] { i, j };
            }
        }
    }
    // If no solution is found, return an empty array
    return new int[] {}; // No solution found
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` - The algorithm uses two nested loops to check every possible pair in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` - No extra space is required apart from the input and output.

#### How It Works:
- The outer loop iterates through the array, and the inner loop checks each subsequent element to find a pair that sums to the target.
- If such a pair is found, the indices are returned immediately.
- If no pair is found, an empty array is returned.

### Optimized Approach using HashMap

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    // Create a hashmap to store the difference and its corresponding index
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

    // Iterate over the array
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Calculate the difference needed to reach the target
        int difference = target - nums[i];

        // If the difference is found in the map, return the indices
        if (map.containsKey(difference)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(difference), i };
        }

        // If the difference is not found, add the current number and its index to the map
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }

    // If no solution is found, return an empty array (though problem guarantees one solution)
    return new int[] {};
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - The algorithm passes through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` - Extra space is used to store the elements and their indices in the hashmap.

#### How It Works:
- A hashmap stores each number in the array and its index.
- For each number, the algorithm calculates the difference needed to reach the target and checks if this difference is already in the hashmap.
- If the difference is found, the indices are returned. Otherwise, the current number and its index are added to the hashmap.

### Main Method to Take User Input

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    // Take input for the size of the array
    System.out.print("Enter the size of the array: ");
    int size = scanner.nextInt();

    // Initialize the array
    int[] nums = new int[size];

    // Take input for the array elements
    System.out.println("Enter the elements of the array:");
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        nums[i] = scanner.nextInt();
    }

    // Take input for the target
    System.out.print("Enter the target value: ");
    int target = scanner.nextInt();

    // Create an instance of the class and call the twoSum method
    _0_TwoSum solution = new _0_TwoSum();
    int[] result = solution.twoSum(nums, target);

    // Print the result
    if (result.length == 2) {
        System.out.println("Indices: " + result[0] + ", " + result[1]);
    } else {
        System.out.println("No solution found.");
    }

    // Close the scanner
    scanner.close();
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The main method takes input from the user for the array size, the array elements, and the target value.
- It then calls the `twoSum` method and prints the result, either as the indices of the elements that sum to the target or a message indicating no solution was found.

### Conclusion

- The brute force approach is easy to understand and implement but is inefficient for large arrays due to its `O(n^2)` time complexity.
- The hashmap-based approach is more efficient with a time complexity of `O(n)`, making it preferable for larger datasets.
- The provided `main` method demonstrates how to take user input and use the `twoSum` method to solve the problem interactively.
